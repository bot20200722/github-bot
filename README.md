# GitHub-Follow-Bot

A bot done with python to follow and unfollow users in GitHub.


## Releases:

There is 2 releases the [Selenium](https://github.com/TheDarkAssassins/Github-Follow-Bot/releases/tag/Selenium) and the [GithubAPI](https://github.com/TheDarkAssassins/Github-Follow-Bot/releases/tag/GitHubAPI)
- The [Selenium](https://github.com/TheDarkAssassins/Github-Follow-Bot/releases/tag/Selenium) release it's faster than the GitHubAPI but it uses more CPU and it's unsafe
- The [GithubAPI](https://github.com/TheDarkAssassins/Github-Follow-Bot/releases/tag/GitHubAPI) release it can be run in the background and it's slow but safe 


## Why I did this?

Somewhere, I read:
- One in ten people you follow will follow you back.
- One in hundred people you follow will star your repos.
- One in thousand people you follow will fork your repos.

Might be true, might be not ü§∑‚Äç.
